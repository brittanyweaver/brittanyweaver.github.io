      <p><strong>What is Universal Design?</strong></p>
      <p>Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be 
        accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless
         of their age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, 
         or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who 
         wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of 
         the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is 
         accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. By considering 
         the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design 
         creates products, services and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, 
         universal design is good design. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYiR7wadcEE">Check Out Why Accessability is Important!</a>

      <div class="job-1 experience-box">
        <p><strong>Universal Design at a Micro Level</strong></p>
        <p>A single design feature or a simple product, designed so that it can be used by 
          as many people as possible.
        </p>
        <p>At this level, the designer is not expected to find one design solution that 
          accommodates the needs of 100% of the population, as Universal Design is not 
          one size fits all. Rather, designers are urged to explore design solutions that are 
          more inclusive; those designs that push the boundaries as far out as possible without 
          compromising the integrity or quality of the product.
        </p>
        <p>If more than one option is available for a design feature, choose the more inclusive 
          feature. For example, when installing a handle on a door, it is always better to opt 
          for a lever handle, rather than a door knob, as the lever handle can be opened using 
          the elbow or a closed fist, benefiting people carrying shopping bags as well as people 
          with limited strength in their hands.
        </p>
        <p>See examples of products that incorporate simple or basic design features which are
           inline which improve the product' s Universal Design.
        </p>        
      </div>          
    <div class="job-1 experience-box">
      <p><strong>Universal Design at a Macro Level</strong></p>
      <p>At this level the designer has the opportunity to combine accessible and 
        usable design features, with customisable or adaptable features, alongside more 
        specialised design solutions that deal with the most extreme usability issues.
      </p>
      <p>By stepping back from the individual features and looking at the product, service 
        or environment as a whole, designers are in a position to investigate alternatives 
        providing equivalent experiences to users.
      </p>
      <p>Examples include a user-friendly website that meets web accessibility initiative's
         (wai) web content accessibility guidelines 2.0 (wcag 2.0), has a customisable user 
         interface, and is compatible with assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <p>From micro to macro, Universal Design has implications for the design of any 
        single feature of a product, service or environment, as well as the design of 
        that product, service or environment as a whole.
