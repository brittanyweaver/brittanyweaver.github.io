        <p><em>Hello there! Thank you for visiting my site. It's great to meet you :)</em></p>
        <p><strong>I am finishing up my fourth and final year here at CU Boulder and am on track to receive a 
            degree<br> in Business and a minor in CTD. My hobbies consist of hiking, camping, catching up with
            friends <br>over family dinner nights and drinks, and drawing here and there. I also love EDM music!
            <br>I've been to Red Rocks more times than I can count.</p>
        <p>My goal for this course is to learn the basics of coding in HTML and know how to create sites for
            <br> future jobs and personal use.</strong></p>
