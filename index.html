      <p><em>Hello there! Thank you for visiting my site. It's great to meet you :)</em></p>
      <p>I am finishing up my fourth and final year here at CU Boulder and am on track to receive a 
          degree in Business and a minor in CTD. My hobbies consist of hiking, camping, catching up with
          friends over family dinner nights and drinks, and drawing here and there. I also love EDM music!
          I've been to Red Rocks more times than I can count.

            I went to this summer!</a> 
          </p>
      <p>My goal for this course is to learn the basics of coding in HTML and know how to create sites for
          future jobs and personal use.</p>
