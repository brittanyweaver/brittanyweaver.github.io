    <p>Here are some photos highlighting some of my favorite experiences this past year! 
      I backpacked through France and Switzerland, visited the Utah Salt Flats, hiked up by Brainard, 
      camped in Yosemite and Yellowstone, and drove to Canada to see the Shamabhala Music Festival.</p>

    <p>I am finishing up my fourth and final year here at CU Boulder and am on track to receive a 
        degree in Business and a minor in CTD. My hobbies consist of hiking, camping, catching up with
        friends over family dinner nights and drinks, and drawing here and there. I also love EDM music!
        I've been to Red Rocks more times than I can count.
