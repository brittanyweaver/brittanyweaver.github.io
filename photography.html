    <p>Here are some photos highlighting some of my favorite experiences this past year! I backpacked through France and Switzerland, visited the Utah Salt Flats, hiked up by Brainard, camped in Yosemite and Yellowstone, and drove to Canada to see the Shamabhala Music Festival.

    <p><em>Mont Blanc, Switzerland</em></p>
    <p>This photo was taken after a steep and terrifying gondola ride up to the top of Mont Blanc. At the top, we had to walk over see-through grates that had a stomach dropping distance from the ground. My sister almost cried, but I was able to get her to the top viewing platform pictured in this photo where we enjoyed a yummy lunch.

    <p><em>Brainard Lake</em></p>
    <p>This photo was taken after a 6 mile hike through Brainard Park. The air was cold as hell, but my friend and I managed to strip and swim around in the water for a while. This was one of my favorite recent hikes.

    <p><em>Charmonix, France</em></p>
    <p>This photo was taken when my twin sister and I hiked down this beautiful mountain in France during our backpacking trip this past summer. We thought the hike wouldn't be that hard, but ended up traversing straight downhill for 5 hours in the rain. Still was one of my favorite hikes and some of the most beautiful views I’ve ever seen.

    <img style="float:left" src="img/grindlewald.jpg" alt="Image of Grindlewald">
    <p><em>Grindelwald, Switzerland</em></p>
    <p>This photo was taken outside of my twin sister and I’s hostel in Grindelwald Switzerland. We sat outside in the grass enjoying some watermelon, some cold beers, and watched the sunset.
